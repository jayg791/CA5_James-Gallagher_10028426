CA5 part A - is designed to test your R skills, . Take your calculator program from CA1 and implement it as a set of 10 functions in R. Submit an R script of your program to moodle and github. Also submit some calls to prove your 10 functions work. CA5 part B - involves modifying your calculator class from CA1 to ensure that it can handle lists of data. You will be required to refactor / rewrite your functions so that they can handle lists. You will need to use lambda, map, filter, reduce and list comprehension in any manner you deem necessary to achieve this.
